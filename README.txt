 HOW TO USE WEB PORTAL
_______________________

No packages are required to be pre-installed.

Open index.html in a Web Browser. This will direct you to the HERIPORT Home page. 
This page includes a brief description of the website, and also displays the carousel, which loads the latest resources. Click on an identifier in the carousel to be redirected to the record's original resource.
Click on other to other Web pages - Search, Browse and About - in the navigation header to be redirected to their relevant Web pages.

If “Search Collections” is clicked on in the navigation header, the Search page is loaded. The search feature allows you to enter an item from any metadata field, producing results whereby this item appears in any of the metadata fields. The results display and you can then click on the title of any result to view the record’s metadata. Click on an identifier in metadata to be redirected to the record's original resource. 30 results are shown at a time and you can use the “Previous” and “Next” buttons to navigate the results. 

If “Browse Collections” is clicked on in the navigation header, the Browse page is loaded. The Browse page provides three options for you to browse by: Title, Date and Archive subject. When either of these options are clicked on, all the records in the central repository are loaded and sorted via the chosen field. The results display and you can then click on the title of any result to view the record’s metadata. Click on an identifier in the metadata to be redirected to the record's original resource. As with search, 30 results are shown at a time and you can use the “Previous” and “Next” buttons to navigate results.

If “About” is clicked on in the navigation header, the About page is loaded. This is an additional Web page on the Web portal that provides you with more information about the project in terms of why it was developed and what it does. The group members are also shown here.

You can navigate between and within all Web pages as the navigation header is consistently displayed.
